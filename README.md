Week 1
This week consisted of creating our Github accounts and starting to learn the basics of Github. This is represented in the way I was able to create this page. We were also asked to find 3 different sources of music data and consider the traits of each source. 

<b>Spotify</b>

<i>What type of music data is contained?</i>
An array of music data including artist, song title, album title and art, duration, date of release, record company, writers, producers,  monthly listeners, relates/similar artists. 

<i>How is the data presented?</i>
The data is presented in either playlists, albums, or singles. There is an option to present the data in alphabetical order, although this is only availble on computers/laptops. 

<i>What is unique or innovative about the dataset and the way it is presented?</i>
The dataset is presented on a consistent black background which gives the application a sleek design which is not used in other music apps. Spotify also creates unique playlists weekly for users. This contains recommendations from artists similar to the ones the user

<b>Week 2</b>
This week we had the task of transcribing a piece of music onto MuseScore. We had to find the sheet music from IMSLP which is an extensive music library. Due to my previous experience studying music and using Scalar which is a similar program to MuseScore, I transcribed the piece and offered guidance to my peers. From a brief lesson on musical notes and their values, my peers were able to follow this process. 
I chose the piece Gymnopedie by Erik Satie due to it's simplicity, however this is still a classical piece of music so the piece still contained many interesting features that we could discuss. We successfully transcribed 8 bars within the time we had in the lab. 

For the individual lab task, we were asked to trancribe at least 10 bars of music and consequently upload this to github.
